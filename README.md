# Grade-12-ICS-Culminating-Online-Voting-System
One of the projects I am most proud of is my culminating project in grade 12 computer science. My partner and I developed an online voting
system for the federal election in 2019. We utilized object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, classes, abstraction, 
encapsulation, and polymorphism to develop a user (voter) base and an administrator base over a server in Java. We also implemented a 
cryptographic algorithm, SHA-256, that would hash every single information the voter inputs such as voter ID, name, address, etcetera. 
This ensures that no one can hack into the server and even if they are able to, they cannot find any information as SHA-256 is an 
algorithm where you can crypt, but not decrypt. This helps us to secure the voterâ€™s information. Additionally, it would send an email 
to the user to ensure that they are right individual with a random-generated code every time login which they would have to enter
before voting. We developed a GUI where the voter logins, enters the code sent to their email, and then are able to vote for their
preferred candidate. At the end of the voting period, results are sent out along with statistics. The reason as to why we built this
is because it provides voters of all ages who are not able to go to a voting poll to vote online and exercise their democratic rights
for the benefit of the country.
